It has found lasting use in **operating systems code** (especially in **kernels**), **device drivers** and **protocol stacks**, but use in application software has been decreasing. C is commonly used on **computer architectures** that range from the largest **supercomputers** to the smallest **microcontrollers** and **embedded systems**.
