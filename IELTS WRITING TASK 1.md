## STRUCTURE

1. Introduction Paragraph
2. Overview Paragraph
3. Body Paragraph 1
4. Body Paragraph 2

#### INTRODUCTION
The first paragraph will be your introduction and that contains a description of the graph - what it shows. IELTS will always give you a description and you can use that information for your introduction but don't copy it. ==You need to paraphrase it==. So write it again using your own English.

## EFFECTIVE SENTENCE STRUCTURE
1. **Position statement**:
	- The price of gas **stood at** $2.75 ger gallon.

4. **Grammar variations** 
	Connecting sentences together makes your writing more interesting and can help to improve your band score - but you shoud aim to vary the way you link sentences. Here are a couple options to try instead of just using "**then**" :
	- CD sales i**ncreased steadily** from 2005 until 2010, ==**then== fell slightly** in the following year.
	- CD sales **increased steadily** from 2005 until 2010, ==**before**== **falling slightly** in the following year.
	- ==**After**== **increasing steadily** from 2005 until 2010, CD sales **fell slightly** in the following year. 
5. **Vocabulary variations**
	Again, these variations increase the range of language you use, which can make your writing more interesting and benefit your band score.
	- ==There was== a slight fall in CD sales in 2010.
	- (The year) 2010 ==saw== a slight fall in CD sales.
	- CD sales ==experienced== a slight fall in 2010.
6. **Giving evidence (data)**
	When you describe the key information in a diagram, it's extremely important to include evidence to support your idea. This means you add data: specific numbers, percentages...
	**For example:**
	- CD sales increased slightly **from 52** (million) **to 70** million units between 2009 and 2010.
	- CD sales increased slightly **from 52** million units in 2010 **to 70** million the following year.
	- CD sales increased **by eight** million units from 2009 to 2010.
	- During the period from 1990 to 1995, there was a decrease in gas prices **from $2.70 to $2.75** per gallon.
	- There was an increase in the sugar export between May and August **from about 10% to over 20%**.
	- The sugar export increased **from approximately 10% to more than 20%** between May and August.
	- From 1990 to 1995, the price of gas experienced a decrease **from $2.75 to $2.70** per gallon.
	- The sugar export witnessed an increase between May and August **from around 10% to over 20%**.

### Vocabulary nore
Note the way we use prepositions with numbers and dates:
For example, 1998 = 45%, 2000 = 20%.
- In 2000 the number fell **to** 20%.
- In 2000 the number fell **by** 25%.
- The number fell/dropped **from** 45% in 1998 **to** 20% in 2010.
- The number fell/dropped **from** 45% **to** 20% between 1995 and 1997.

You can use a combination of ==**verb + adverb**==, or ==**adjective + noun**==, to avoid repeating the same phrases and to add extra meaning:
- The was **a significant increase/rise** in the number of X.
- The number of X **increased/rose significantly**.
Notice that you need a preposition when you use the noun form:
- There was an increase **in** house prices;
- There was a drop **of** 10% in the number of male students who studied abroad.
